# Proven
Currently a tiny user script to show other Keybase proofs on Twitter user
profiles. The goal is to build this into a full WebExtension that works on all
sites where a user can prove their identity using Keybase.

Current version available for install on
    [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/35054-proven).
